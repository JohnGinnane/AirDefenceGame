WW ONE AIR DEFENCE:

destroying blimp sometimes spawn a guy in a parachute (cannot kill them)

have 1910s music play during quiet times, then reduce vol to 0 and introduce air raid siren for new wave
stereo sound effects (might need to write lib for this)
blimps need engine sound effect

later in game you can get controllable biplane that has limited fuel and ammo
preferable to land it to reuse, otherwise its gone for duration of wave
need to implement village with a church steeple prominent
if too many buildings are destroyed then no more music
if all buildings are destroyed then you lose

start off with machine gun
purchase flak (+ upgrades)
purchase rocket (+ upgrades)

have each emplacement be in a different place

maybe flak and rockets must slowly move towards crosshair, whereas machine gun can fire immediately where crosshair is aimed DONE

 MACHINE GUN:
1. low RPM machine gun
2. high RPM / heavy machine gun
3. water jacket to improve cooling
4. incendiary ammo (used in 1916)

FLAK:
1. fixed time flak
2. variable time flak (large circle whose radius you can increase/decrease)
3. altimeter flak (horizontal bar you can move up/down)
3. magnetic/proximity flak (not invented until ww2 so maybe dont do)

SPOT LIGHTS FOR NIGHT TIME MISSIONS
rocket (1916 - le prieur rocket)
tow rocket (ww2)
lightning rocket (sci-fi)

DIFFICULTY:
Changes to difficulty do not change damage or health
Easy: 
Infinite ammo / no reload / no overheating
Enemies fly in slow straight lines

Medium:
Must reload weapons / do not constantly fire or over heat (over heat either stops usage or makes it fire more and more inaccurately (preference: latter))
enemies move up and down perhaps?

Hard:
Enemies throw out metal fragments to throw off magnetic projectiles (counter measures)
Move really fast to avoid fire
Maybe have multiple gas compartments, destroying a compartment makes it lose altitude
Destroy gondola to take out balloon completely?
